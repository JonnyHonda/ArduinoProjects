<h1>Motorcycle Temperature Display</h1>
 
<h2>Outline</h2>
 
<p>The aim of this project is to prototype a dual temperature display module
for use in a motorcyle fairing.
</p>
<p>
One sensor is to be place one the water cooling pipes and the other 
either in the project box or some not to exposed area of the bike to record
the air temperature.
</p>
<p>The design is to include two warning LEDs, one to warn when air temp is
 nearing zero celsius and the other to warn when water temp is over 90 celsius </p>
